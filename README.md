# Kanban esoteric edition

Kanban Esoteric Edition is a web app where groups of users can create and modify Kanban 
boards. Admin users can create boards either manually or based on a template. Boards will 
contain items (such as tasks), and these items will always have a status (e.g., "In Development" 
or "Done"). All users can view the boards of their group, update the status of items, and log their 
time spent working on an item.
